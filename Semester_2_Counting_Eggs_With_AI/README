Assume all files in this example are located within the same directory.  Then the program can be run as follows:

Example 1: "python3 finalAlgo.py "img.jpg" > output.txt"
Example 2: "python3 coutingEggsWithAI.py "image1.jpg" "image2.jpg" > output.txt"

The output file will contain a list of egg counts formatted as such:
"Number of eggs in file <file_name>: <egg_count>"

Output can also be redirected to stdout.
