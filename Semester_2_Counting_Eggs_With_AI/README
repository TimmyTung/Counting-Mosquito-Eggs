SETUP:
1. Install python3 for your operating system.  See the following reference for more detailed information: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
2. Pip3 should be included with the newest version of python downloaded from step 1.  If it is not, see the following source for downloading pip3: https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/how-to-install-and-use-pip3/#:~:text=Python%203.4%2B%20in%20most%20operating,3.9)%2C%20which%20includes%20pip3.
3. Ensure everything is installed correctly using:
        a. Check python: "python --version"
        b. Check pip3: "pip3 --version"
4. Install required files using the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"


Assume all files in this example are located within the same directory.  Then the program can be run as follows:

Example 1: "python3 --sheet finalAlgo.py "img.jpg" > output.txt"
Example 2: "python3 --stack coutingEggsWithAI.py "image1.jpg" "image2.jpg" > output.txt"
Example 3: "python3 --stack --boxes coutingEggsWithAI.py "image1.jpg" "image2.jpg" > output.txt"

The output file will contain a list of egg counts formatted as such:
"Number of eggs in file <file_name>: <egg_count>"

Parameters:
--sheet or --stack MUST be provided and are defined as follows:
	1. a --sheet image is a zoomed out image where the mosquito eggs are relatively small and numerous; usually taken without a microscope 
	2. a --stack image is a zoomed in image where mosquito eggs are larger and there are fewer eggs; this is usually taken with a microscope
--boxes is an optional tag and is defined as followed:
	1. a --boxes tag will output the image provided with bounding boxes surrounding egg clusters along with egg count for each cluster located in the center of the box

Output can also be redirected to stdout.
