Assume all files in this example are located within the same directory.  Then the program can be run as follows:

Example 1: "python3 --sheet finalAlgo.py "img.jpg" > output.txt"
Example 2: "python3 --stack coutingEggsWithAI.py "image1.jpg" "image2.jpg" > output.txt"

The output file will contain a list of egg counts formatted as such:
"Number of eggs in file <file_name>: <egg_count>"

Parameters:
--sheet or --stack MUST be provided and are defined as follows:
	1. a --sheet image is a zoomed out image where the mosquito eggs are relatively small and numerous; usually taken without a microscope 
	2. a --stack image is a zoomed in image where mosquito eggs are larger and there are fewer eggs; this is usually taken with a microscope

Output can also be redirected to stdout.
