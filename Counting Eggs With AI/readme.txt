Assume all files used in the following example are located in the same directory.  Then the program can be run as follows:

Example 1: "python3 coutingEggsWithAI.py "image1.tif" > output.txt"
Example 2: "python3 coutingEggsWithAI.py "image1.tif" "image2.tif" > output.txt"

Running this command will export a new image file with the bounding boxes and the number of eggs for each respective bounding box.
It will also output the number of eggs present in each image.  Multiple images can be run at once, as seen in example 2.
